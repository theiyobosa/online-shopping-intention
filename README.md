<h1>Online Shopping Intention</h1>

<h2>Scope</h2>

This repository contains my solution to the <a href="https://dphi.tech/challenges/data-sprint-57-online-shopping-intention/179/overview/about">Online Shopping Intention</a> Datathon by <a href="https://dphi.tech">DPhi</a>. This challenge was part hosted by <a href="https://dphi.tech">DPhi</a>.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

The recent surge in online shopping has given the business world a new dimension. People frequently search the internet for the products they require and purchase them through online transactions. It has made their lives more convenient and comfortable. Simultaneously, the sellers must understand the patterns and intentions of the customers.

The objective here is to build a Machine Learning model that can help in predicting whether a customer will purchase or not. 

<h2>Data</h2>

The dataset consists of two csv files. The training_data.csv is for training the model. While the testing_data.csv is for the final submission, it does not contain the target variable.

The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes.

An explanation of the meaning of the attributes can be found in the data.txt file in this repository.

<h2>Modelling</h2>

The final metric for scoring the model, will be the F1 score of submission file (result.csv) that I have created.

<h2>Aftermath</h2>

After training, the model had an F1 score of <b>66 percent</b> on the validation dataset. The test dataset with which the datathon was graded on, also had an F1 score of <b>66 percent</b>. The test dataset prediction file that was submitted for grading is presented here as <b>result.csv</b>.

The leaderboard for the challenge can be found <a href="https://dphi.tech/challenges/data-sprint-57-online-shopping-intention/179/leaderboard/public/">here</a>, my name there is "<b>theiyobosa</b>", same as my GitHub name.
